"""Build/update the preview object shown while tweaking a patch, and bake a
confirmed preview into the persistent per-source-object retopology result
mesh.

Stitching adjacent patches: only a patch's *corner* vertices are guaranteed
to be exact, un-resampled source-mesh vertices, so they are the only points
safe to weld across neighboring patches purely by identity (the same source
vertex index always maps to the same welded result vertex). Interior
boundary points are span-dependent resample points that only coincide
between two patches when their spans happen to match exactly along the
shared edge; blindly proximity-welding them (e.g. bmesh.ops.remove_doubles)
can silently merge unrelated points and drop faces, so we deliberately do
NOT do that here. To actually get matching spans (and therefore a fully
welded, seam-free result), see the span propagation registry below: every
commit records, per pair of corner vertex ids, the span used along that
boundary; generating a new patch looks up its own corner pairs in that
registry and uses any match as its default span for that direction.

Re-editing a committed patch: each baked face records which Plasticity face it
came from (PATCH_ID_ATTR) and each patch records the spans it was built with
(PATCH_SPANS_PROP), so a patch can be picked again, come back with its own
spans, and be committed a second time -- replacing its old faces instead of
doubling up on them.

The visual "push off the surface" used to see the preview clearly is done
with a non-destructive Displace modifier on the preview object, not baked
into its mesh data -- so Commit (which reads the preview's base mesh, not
its modifier-evaluated geometry) always bakes the true, un-offset position.

Preview and result are lifted by the *same* measure (result_lift), the
preview by a little more (PREVIEW_LIFT_RATIO). They are always seen
together -- side by side across a shared boundary, and stacked while a
committed patch is hovered before the click that removes its faces -- so
the preview sitting on the surface while the result floated above it read
as the committed blue patch swallowing the orange one being built.

# read back later:
#
# - a face the knife created carries NO_PATCH, so the patch it belongs to reads

# - a vertex the knife created inherits its neighbours' `retop_source_vid`,

#   by identity, so the next commit touching that corner would either drag the
#   new vertex onto it or reuse it in the corner's place.
#
# Faces are handled by `adopt_untracked_faces`, which already classifies an
# untagged face onto the patch it sits on and refuses to guess without a strict
# majority. Vertex ids are handled below, and the rule is deliberately not "is
# this vertex where the corner is" alone: a *deliberate* nudge of a corner is
# exactly what this mode exists for, and stripping its identity for having
# moved a hair would undo the fix on the next commit.

    Two answers, deliberately. Both patches usually resample the same polyline,

    a coarse neighbour whose chords sag off a curved boundary, or two CAD edges
