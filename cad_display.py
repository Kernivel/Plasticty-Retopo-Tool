"""What the CAD surface looks like underneath the triangles, for the viewport.

The bridge sends a triangle soup plus `groups`/`face_ids`. No edges, no
vertices, no surface parameters -- the Plasticity protocol carries none of it
(see patch_data). So a mesh imported through it shows as a uniform field of
triangles, and the two things worth seeing while retopologizing it are exactly
the two things that field hides:

**Where one CAD face ends and the next begins.** That *is* recoverable, and
exactly: a boundary half-edge (a, b) of one patch is matched by (b, a) of the
patch on the other side, so every B-rep edge is the maximal run of boundary
segments whose neighbouring face id does not change, and every B-rep vertex is
where it does. Those are facts about the model, not estimates.

**Which way the surface runs.** That is *not* recoverable. Plasticity's own
isoparametric curves come from each face's NURBS parameterisation, and none of
it crosses the bridge. What can be built instead is the flow implied by the
face's own boundary: split it into sides the way the generators do, run the
same Coons interpolation over it, and draw the resulting grid. On a fillet or a
swept face those lines land very close to the true isoparms, because both are
answering the same question about the same boundary -- but they are derived,
not imported, and the panel says so. They are also the more useful of the two
here: they show the topology the retopology would actually get.

Everything is cached per mesh, keyed on the same fingerprint `patch_data` uses.
A draw handler runs on every redraw, and none of this may be recomputed there.
