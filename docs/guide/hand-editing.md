# Hand-editing the result

Sometimes the generators get a boundary wrong — a side whose neighbour could not
be matched, two boundaries that ended up one vertex apart, a merge that did not
take — and the fix is a few vertex moves and one extra edge.

Every tool for that already exists in Blender, and **all of them are Edit Mode
operators**: merge by distance, vertex snapping, knife, loop cut,
connect-vertex-path. There is no version of this that stays in Object Mode; an
Object-Mode reimplementation would be a worse knife and a worse snap, written
twice.

So <kbd>Tab</kbd> hands the viewport over.

<!-- media: 20s. Tab into the trip, knife one cut across two patches, drag a
     vertex onto its twin so auto-merge fires, Tab back, status line shows the
     repair counts. -->

## The trip

<kbd>Tab</kbd> from the **Patch** phase (choosing a surface) or from the
**Object** phase (where the *selection* names the object). `<Object>_Retop` is
selected, made active, and opened in Edit Mode with everything a manual pass
needs already set up. <kbd>Tab</kbd> again comes back.

From there it is all Blender: <kbd>K</kbd> knife, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
loop cut, <kbd>J</kbd> connect, <kbd>G</kbd> move, <kbd>M</kbd> merge,
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> select mode. The addon owns only the two ends of
the trip.

!!! danger "Never from the Adjust phase"

    A patch open for adjustment has its faces **out** of the result mesh, with
    only a snapshot to put them back — and Blender discards writes to a mesh it
    holds in Edit Mode, so the patch would be gone for good. Commit or
    <kbd>Esc</kbd> first. The key and the panel button both refuse with the same
    reason.

## What is set up for you

- **Vertex snapping, including onto the mesh being edited.** The whole point is
  dragging a vertex onto its twin in the *same* mesh, which Blender's default
  (other objects only) makes impossible.
- **Auto-merge** at *Auto-Merge Distance*, so closing a seam is a drag rather
  than a drag followed by a Merge by Distance that gets forgotten once and leaves
  a crack nobody sees until export.
- **Face Nearest** on top (*Snap to CAD Surface*), so a dragged vertex stays on
  the CAD surface. Turn it off when the surface is in your way.
- **Vertex select mode.**
- **The result drawn in front** (*Draw In Front While Editing*, on by default),
  because the vertices you are dragging are the point of the trip and the CAD
  surface hides half of them. It is Blender's In Front flag and not an offset:
  nothing moves, so what is on screen is still exactly where the topology is.

Settings are read on the way **in**, so changing one mid-edit does nothing until
the next trip. The panel says so.

**Your own snapping and auto-merge settings are saved on the way in and put back
on the way out** — including when the session ends mid-edit, and when a trip is
closed by the mode dropdown or by a script rather than by <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

## The repair, on the way back

Blender knows nothing about this addon's attributes, and the two it gets wrong
are the two read back later.

**Faces the knife created carry no patch tag.** The patch then reads as partly
"never retopped", and a re-edit stacks a second grid on it. They are re-adopted
onto the patch they sit on.

**New vertices inherit a neighbour's "I am CAD corner N" tag**, i.e. they claim
to be a CAD corner they are nowhere near — and the next commit that touched that
corner would weld onto the wrong point. Those identities are dropped.

The status line says how many of each it dealt with.

!!! note "How a stray corner identity is decided"

    Three ways, and "it moved" is the weakest.

    - **Out of range** for the source mesh is certain — an interpolated integer
      between two real ids is not an index.
    - **Two vertices naming the same source vertex** is certain too: one CAD
      corner is one result vertex, and the nearer one keeps it.
    - **Distance alone** only fires past a generous share of the model's bounding
      box. Nudging a corner by hand is what this mode is *for*, and stripping its
      identity for having moved a hair would undo the fix on the next commit that
      touched it.

    Clearing is always the safe direction: a vertex with no id welds by proximity
    like every other boundary point, which is what a hand-placed vertex should do.
