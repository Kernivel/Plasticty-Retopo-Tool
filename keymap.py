"""Which key does what — declared here, owned by Blender.

The session's keys were `event.type == 'X'` comparisons inside `operators._modal`.
That leaves nothing to remap and nothing in Blender's keymap editor to find
either, because a modal operator reads raw events and sits *above* every
keymap. Making them remappable by hand meant a table, a capture modal and a
panel to draw it in — a second, worse keymap editor living next to Blender's.

So they are real `KeyMapItem`s on real operators now, and Blender owns all of
it: the editing UI, the conflict display, the per-item restore, the
persistence in the user's preferences. This module only *declares* what to
register. The addon's preferences page draws them with `rna_keymap_ui.draw_kmi`
— the same rows the keymap editor uses — and the panel's Keybinds tab is a
button that opens it.

**Who dispatches them is a second question, and the answer differs by scope.**
`GLOBAL` actions are dispatched by Blender, like any keymap item, because they
must work with no session running. `SESSION` actions are dispatched by the
modal, which reads the live items and runs the matching operator itself.

That is not belt-and-braces. A key in the 3D View keymap does not reliably beat
one in a *mode* keymap, and the session's keys collide with mode keymaps
constantly -- `X` is `object.delete` in Object Mode, `Tab` is
`object.editmode_toggle` in Object Non-modal. Registering each action in
whichever keymap owns its competitor is unmaintainable and still leaves the
next addon to claim the key; MACHIN3 puts its own `Alt+X` in `Mesh` rather than
`3D View` for exactly this reason. The modal sits above every keymap, so
dispatching from there always wins, and the items stay real -- editable in
Blender's rows, listed in the keymap editor, saved in the user's preferences.

The failure it prevents is not cosmetic: with `X` falling through, deleting a
patch that turned out not to be committed reached `object.delete` and took the
CAD object with it.

Two things stay outside all of this:

- **the digits and Backspace**, numeric entry rather than a shortcut: they must
  stay instantaneous and they only make sense as a block;
- **the mirror's `Alt+X` then `X`/`Y`/`Z`**, a key *sequence*, which Blender's
  keymap has no notion of.

The left click is *half* outside. Taking the side under the cursor is a normal
binding (`pin_neighbour`); what stays in the modal is the
fallback when there is no side under the cursor, which commits — that one
genuinely depends on the hover, and the modal hands the event over whenever it
doesn't apply.
