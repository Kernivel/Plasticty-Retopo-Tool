"""Which vertices a patch's side has to reproduce, and where they come from.

Two patches only weld along a shared boundary if they land on the *same
vertices*, not merely on the same count -- a neighbour committed as an n-gon
put its points where the boundary curves, and a grid resampling evenly to that
same count lands between them every time. So a side takes the neighbour's own
committed vertices, and the generator is told the count that reproduces them
(`geometry.resample_polyline_by_arclength` hands a polyline straight back when
asked for exactly as many points as it holds, so no generator needed changing).

Three things decide what a side may take:

- **what it borders.** A side can only match the Plasticity faces actually
  across it, which the mesh states per boundary segment. Proximity alone cannot
  tell those from a patch that merely passes nearby, and matching used to be
  proximity alone -- which is how a side ended up following a run of vertices
  tracing a loop through its neighbourhood instead of the edge it shares.
- **who asked.** An automatic match takes only an exact answer. A pin -- you
  pointed at the side, so you have said which neighbour you mean -- may reach
  one that has drifted, by `match_margin`.
- **whether the spans still allow it.** A grid has one count per *direction*,
  so two sides wanting different counts along one axis cannot both be honoured,
  and a count the user typed since releases the match rather than being
  overruled by it.

Kept out of `operators` for the same reason `patchprep` is, plus one more: the
overlay draws what a match would take, and a draw handler must never be able to
reach the operators module.

    A disc, a circular pocket floor, the cap of a cylinder: nothing on the
    boundary is a corner, so `sides.synthesise_corners` cuts it into four at
    the quarter points of its arc length. Those four are arbitrary -- the loop
    had to be split somewhere to have sides, and no other part of the model
    agrees on where. Which is exactly why matching could never work on one.

    The neighbour has its own vertices along that same circle, at its own
    phase, and the quarter points fall *between* them. The endpoint rule in
    `match_side_to_points` then asks each side for a committed vertex at a
    corner the neighbour has no reason to have one at, and whether it finds one
    is a coin toss per corner: measured on a truncated cone's cap, two of the
    four sides landed within 0.0026 of a rim vertex and matched, while the
    other two had theirs claimed by the side next door (it lies *on* that one)
    and refused with "neighbour stops short of this side's start". Nothing
    about the tolerances fixes that -- widening them far enough to swallow a
    whole vertex spacing is what the half-cell offset rule exists to prevent.

    So the loop is re-cut instead. The whole boundary is matched **once**, as
    the closed side it really is -- which is the path `_close_matched_ring`
    already handles, rotation and all -- and the sides are then carved out of
    the neighbour's own ring of points. Every corner lands on a neighbour
    vertex at distance zero, so the strict tolerance passes and *automatic*
    matching fires, where before even a hand pin refused half the sides.

    Two things this deliberately gives up, both of which the loop had nothing
    to lose in the first place:

    - the corner ids, blanked to `NO_SOURCE` because the new corners are not
      source vertices at all. They weld by proximity like every other boundary
      point, and span propagation out of this patch stops -- its corners were
      never B-rep vertices, so the pairs it would have registered named
      nothing any neighbour could look up.
    - the side count is *kept*, which is what makes this safe everywhere else:
      `find_generator` still sees four sides, and the commit path -- which
      re-prepares the patch and replays the same references by index -- still
      lines up.

    Only a loop `sides` flagged arbitrary comes here. A shape corner (the end
    of a strip, a slot's cap) is a fact about the boundary and is never moved.

    Returns whether it re-cut.
