"""Parsing of Plasticity "patches" (CAD faces) out of the triangulated mesh
produced by the plasticity-blender-addon bridge.

The bridge stores two custom properties on the imported mesh:
  mesh["groups"]    -- flat list of [loop_start, loop_count] pairs, in polygon order
  mesh["face_ids"]  -- one Plasticity face id per group, same order as the pairs

A "patch" is the set of triangles that share one face_id. This module rebuilds,
for a given mesh, the polygon->face_id mapping and the boundary loop(s) of each
patch (the edges where a patch touches a different patch or the outer boundary
of the solid).

**Everything here is cached per mesh** (see `analyse`). The parse walks every
polygon, builds a KD-tree over the vertices that can carry a duplicate and a
directed-half-edge table over every triangle corner -- and the session used to redo all of it on *every mouse
move*, because hovering a patch re-prepares it. On a CAD part of any size that
is the difference between a smooth hover and a stuttering one. Nothing in a
Plasticity mesh changes while it is being retopologized, so the result is keyed
by a fingerprint of the mesh's own contents and reused until that changes.

    index, merging vertices within `epsilon` of each other.

    The Plasticity bridge tessellates each CAD face independently, so the two
    faces meeting along a B-rep edge each carry their own copy of every vertex
    on it. Boundary detection has to treat those copies as one point, or every
    patch border reads as two unrelated free edges -- and, on a mesh whose
    interior is *also* unshared, every internal triangulation edge looks like a
    patch boundary too. This mirrors a "Merge by Distance" pass without
    modifying the mesh.

    Only `weld_candidates` takes part: an interior vertex has nothing to merge
    with, and leaving it out of the KD-tree both costs less and removes any
    chance that proximity alone collapses two distinct points on a densely
    tessellated fillet. When nothing can be excluded the whole mesh goes in,
    which is the previous behaviour exactly.

    **The epsilon is capped by the mesh's own shortest edge, and that cap is
    not a refinement.** An edge is the mesh saying outright that its two ends
    are distinct points of the surface; welding across one destroys it. The
    triangle carrying it goes degenerate, its two directed corners are dropped
    as `a == b`, and the patch's directed boundary -- balanced by construction,
    one outgoing and one incoming per polygon corner -- stops being balanced.
    `compute_boundary_loops` then walks into a dead end, hands back an *open
    chain* as if it were a loop, and every reader closes it with `% n`: a chord
    from its last vertex straight back to its first, drawn across a face the
    model never divided, with the patch reporting five or seven boundary loops
    where it has one. A part whose smallest features sit at the epsilon
    triggers that readily -- on one, 205 real edges were collapsed in a single
    object and 101 of its 245 loops came back open.

    Capping rather than testing adjacency pair by pair, because the pairwise
    test cannot answer this: when two genuinely distinct positions both fall
    inside the epsilon, the cluster has to be *split* by position, and which
    copy is edge-joined to which is an accident of how the bridge happened to
    emit the triangles. Half the shortest edge is the largest radius at which
    no cluster can span two of them. The copies this exists to merge are
    unaffected: they are the same double rounded the same way twice, so they
    sit at a distance of zero, not of the epsilon.

    `epsilon` is absolute, in the mesh's own local units. See the note in
    CLAUDE.md: on a part far from the origin it is close enough to the float32
    ulp that two faces' copies of a shared vertex can fail to meet.

    Plasticity tessellates each face on its own, and on a real part it does not
    always agree with itself: the finer side drops vertices in the middle of
    the coarser side's segments, so the reversed half-edge is not there and the
    segment reports no neighbour at all.

    That reads downstream as an open boundary, and an open boundary is not a
    quiet degradation. `detect_topological_corners` fires wherever the
    neighbour changes, so every one of those segments becomes a phantom B-rep
    vertex; the side count is what picks the generator, so the patch is filled
