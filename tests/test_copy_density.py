"""Run inside Blender: blender --background --python tests/test_copy_density.py

Copying one committed patch's density onto another.

Span propagation already handles two patches that *touch*: they share a
boundary, so they have to agree or they crack. This is the other half -- two
patches that never meet and want the same density anyway, which nothing in the
mesh can work out on its own.

What makes it answerable is that the generator each patch was built by is
recorded at commit time, alongside its spans. A count copied between two
different generators would be a number with a different meaning: a Ring's two
are around and across, a Quad's are its own U and V. So the copy is refused
across generators, and this pins that as much as the copy itself.
