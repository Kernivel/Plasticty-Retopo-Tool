"""Run inside Blender: blender --background --python tests/test_overlay.py

The viewport overlays: their draw handlers, and the keybind hints.

This file exists because the suite once passed with `overlay.enable()` raising
`NameError` on a function that had been deleted by an over-eager edit. Nothing
called it -- the draw handlers are the one part of the addon that only Blender
invokes, so unless a test does it too, a missing name gets found by the user.
So: install the handlers, and call every callback.
