"""Run inside Blender: blender --background --python tests/test_registration.py

The addon is fully type-annotated, and a Blender addon is the one place where
that can go wrong silently. A property is declared as an *annotation* --
`active_face_id: bpy.props.IntProperty(...)`, with nothing after an `=` -- so
the thing Blender reads to register it is the thing PEP 563
(`from __future__ import annotations`) stringifies. Where a Blender resolves
those strings back, everything works; where it does not, the PropertyGroup
registers *nothing*, nothing raises, and the panel simply draws empty while
every `state.<anything>` blows up somewhere unrelated.

Blender 5.0 does resolve them, as it happens -- verified by adding the future
import and watching all 73 properties register anyway. That is not a reason to
rely on it: `bl_info` declares 4.2 as the minimum, the behaviour is a property
of the Blender being run rather than of this code, and the failure mode is the
silent kind. So the addon simply never imports that future (3.11 evaluates
`list[int]` and `X | None` unaided) and this pins the choice.

The same reasoning keeps annotations off the *class-body attributes* of a
registered class: that dict is the one place the registration walk looks, and
a `_hover_obj: bpy.types.Object | None = None` sitting among the real
properties is asking it to make sense of something that is not one. Methods
are free -- their annotations live on the function object, which nothing
registers.

So this asserts both halves: the properties really are there, *and* the source
rules that keep them there. The outcome alone would pass on a lenient Blender
right up until someone ran an older one.
