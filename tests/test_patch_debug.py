"""Run inside Blender: blender --background --python tests/test_patch_debug.py

The patch data debug display: `patch_data.group_report`, the labels
`cad_display` places from it, and how the cursor chooses between them.

Three things are pinned here, and the second is the reason the first exists.

**Triangulation is not required.** The bridge offers an untriangulated export
and nothing in this addon cares: `polygon_face_ids` walks the group ranges in
loop-index space, and `geometry.build_bvh_with_polygon_map` fan-triangulates
whatever it is handed. So a quad mesh must come back with an empty problem list
and its patches assigned correctly -- only `triangulated` says which export was
used. Reporting it as a fault would send people re-exporting to fix something
that was never broken.

**Ranges that no longer land on polygon boundaries are.** That is the failure
worth warning about, because `polygon_face_ids` cannot see it: it hands a
polygon to whichever range it falls in and returns a complete, plausible,
wrong answer. The corruption test therefore asserts both that the report names
the problem *and* that the assignment really does go wrong -- without the
second half the warning could be firing on a case that does not matter.

**Which patch gets labelled is a cursor position.** A draw handler is handed no
event, so the hover modal leaves `(object name, face id)` in a module global on
`overlay` and the display resolves the target from there -- which means the two
states nothing else can produce have to be safe: no hover at all (a reload, a
file load, the pointer off the viewport) and a hover naming an object that has
since gone away.
