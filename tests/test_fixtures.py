"""Run inside Blender: blender --background --python tests/test_fixtures.py

Retopologize real bridge output and pin what comes out.

Every other test in this suite builds its mesh from the same mental model as
the code, which means none of them can catch "the bridge emits X and we
assumed Y". These fixtures were made in Plasticity and imported through the
bridge, so they are the only place that assumption is actually tested. See
tests/fixtures/README.md for what each shape is for.

Three kinds of assertion, deliberately separated:

- **invariants** -- true of any correct retopology, whatever the tuning
  constants say. A planar face must be reproduced exactly; nothing may come
  out non-manifold. These are the ones worth being strict about.
- **golden values** -- what the pipeline happens to do today. They exist to
  make a change *visible*, not because the numbers are sacred: a tweak to
  CORNER_CLIFF that silently re-routes every bevel is the failure this
  catches. Regenerate with scripts/gen_expectations.py and read the diff;
  never hand-edit. Note that the vertex and face counts are **order
  sensitive** -- this test commits in the fixture's own face order, and span
  propagation seeds everything downstream from whichever patch commits first,
  so the same shapes in a different order legitimately produce a different
  count. Generator and side count per face are the entries that should hold
  steady.
- **known gaps** -- things that are wrong today and recorded as wrong. These
  fail when they start *working*, so that fixing one forces the expectations
  here to be updated rather than leaving a test that quietly asserts a bug.

Deviation figures are a percentage of each object's bounding-box diagonal,
measured across face interiors -- never at vertices, which the generators put
on the surface by construction. The measurement code is imported from
scripts/benchmark.py so the suite and the by-hand tool cannot drift apart.
